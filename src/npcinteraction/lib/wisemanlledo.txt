Greetings. I am old and thus very wise.
>Would you like to hear advice for your quest?
->To free Mysteria, you must sleigh the Dark Wurm, who is locked deep in the city.
-->As you likely know, the gates to the city are locked.
--->Luckily, there is a somewhat secret entrance that no one has found somehow.
---->South of Village 3, there is a well which will take you into the sewer.
----->That sewer will lead you to a well inside the city walls.
------>Beware, in the city the wormers will be stronger than those you've faced so far.
------->I wish you luck hero.
->Oh. Then would you like to hear a joke?
-->How can you tell if your girlfriend or dog loves you more?
--->...
---->Dang. I can't remember the punch line.
-->You're missing out son.
