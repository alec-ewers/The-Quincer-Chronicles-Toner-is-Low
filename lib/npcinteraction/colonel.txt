What are you doing here? I'm in hiding!
>No, I'm not hiding from the wormers. I'm hiding from something much more terrifying...
->A group of teenage boys from San Carlos High School
-->They kidnapped me from my home. I narrowly escaped and now I'm here.
--->That was decades ago but I'm convinced they're after me. I've chosen to hide here on Mysteria.
---->Well you're here, want some chicken?
----->Here you go, young man! ~r
----->Well I'm sure sorry to hear that.
