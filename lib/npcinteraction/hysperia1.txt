Hi there. I'm Hysperia.
>So you are the one who fell from the sky. I didn’t believe it at first, but you look . . . different.
->If you are some sort of chosen one, I guess I have no room to be skeptical. We need all the help that we can get.
-->The Wormers use dark magic, and they have turned our people to stone. You managed to fall into the only village which hasn’t been touched by their evil presence. The other villages have all been overrun
--->If you're going to do anything, you need to go free those villages. They won’t be expecting you, and if you move fast, we may yet win the day.
---->May fortune smile upon you, strange traveler. We are all counting on you
