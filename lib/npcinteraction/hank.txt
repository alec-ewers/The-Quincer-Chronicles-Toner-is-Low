Did you just crash from the sky? Are you OK?
>Good good.
->Say, you look like a mighty hero. Would you like a quest?
-->Great to hear! The wormers have taken over our planet and we need your help.
--->You must travel around the map defeating Wormer Shamans to liberate our map.
---->There are three villages, each with a shaman.
----->I would liberate village 1, which is northwest of here, first. The wormers are weaker
------>Once you've killed all three shamans, find your way into the city to kill...
------->the Dark Wurm, the wormer king. Once you do that, you'll be free from the wormers.
-------->I hear that the villages are home to alchemists and blacksmiths.
--------->They can sell you potions and upgrades to your armor and sword.
---------->Once you liberate a village, its leader would be happy to restore your health.
----------->Good luck, brave hero.
-->I'm sorry to hear that... We could really use your help.
>If you need to freshen up, my buddy in the cabin can restore your health.
